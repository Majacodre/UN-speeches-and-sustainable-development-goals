This project aims to analyse the relationship between UN speeches and income inequality and perception of corruption.

Since 1946, representatives of United Nation (UN) member states have participated annually in the UN General Debate, a platform for articulating and advocating their perspectives on key global issues, such as world hunger, poverty and peace. In 2015, the UN formalized many of these objectives, establishing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which aim to eliminate poverty, protect the environment and promote peace and prosperity by 2030. Analyzing historical UN General Debate speeches provides an opportunity to assess their relevance to SDG progress.

This project investigates economic inequality; specifically, how issues of economic inequality are addressed through UN General Debate speeches. As a way to gauge economic inequality, two metrics are emphasized: the Gini-Coefficient, a measure of income inequality within a country, and Perception of Corruption, a variable which captures a country’s perceived level of political and economic corruption. Utilizing these metrics as proxies for economic inequality, this project examines how language used in past UN General Debate speeches relates to higher or lower levels of inequality and offers insights into how global political discourse reflects and engages with the objectives of Sustainable Development Goal 10. Guided by these aims, this study addresses the following research questions.

**Exploratory:** What is the relationship between income inequality and corruption across countries, and does the frequency of corruption- and income inequality-related mentions in political speeches align with observed levels of economic inequality?
 
  **Hypothesis:** There is a positive correlation between income inequality and corruption. Additionally, it is expected that a higher frequency of corruption/income inequality-related mentions in political speeches is associated with higher levels of economic inequality.

**Predictive** Can we predict a country’s degree of economic inequality from language used in its political speeches?
 
  **Hypothesis:** A country’s degree of economic inequality can be predicted from the words in its political speeches
